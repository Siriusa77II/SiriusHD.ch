<br>
EXT. FRONT YARD.  DAY.<br>
<br>
        Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of<br>
        unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class<br>
        residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in<br>
        shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram<br>
        to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed<br>
        Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades<br>
        point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be<br>
        ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An<br>
        attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.<br>
<br>
        Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the<br>
        front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.<br>
<br>
INT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY.<br>
<br>
                                WOMAN<br>
                                (screams)<br>
                    Oough! Ahhh!<br>
<br>
                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT<br>
                                (to others)<br>
                    Upstairs.<br>
<br>
        Troops pour into the house.<br>
<br>
                                WOMAN<br>
                    What's going on? What's the matter?<br>
                    Who are you?<br>
<br>
        The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue<br>
        entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles<br>
        ready.<br>
<br>
                                WOMAN<br>
                    Hey!<br>
<br>
        Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops<br>
        descend on a bedroom.<br>
<br>
                                WOMAN<br>
                                (off camera)<br>
                    Dade! Dade!<br>
<br>
                                AGENT<br>
                    Knock it down.<br>
<br>
        The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.<br>
<br>
INT. COURTROOM.<br>
<br>
        The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing<br>
        argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.<br>
<br>
                                PROSECUTOR<br>
                    The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls<br>
                    himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly<br>
                    committed criminal acts of a malicious<br>
                    nature. This defendant possesses a<br>
                    superior intelligence, which he uses to a<br>
                    destructive and antisocial end. His<br>
                    computer virus crashed one thousand five<br>
                    hundred and seven computer systems,<br>
                    including Wall Street trading systems,<br>
                    single handedly causing a seven point drop<br>
                    in the New York Stock Market.<br>
<br>
        As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning<br>
        down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade<br>
        Murphy.<br>
<br>
        Fast forward to the sentencing.<br>
<br>
                                JUDGE<br>
                    Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family<br>
                    forty-five thousand dollars...<br>
<br>
        The court gasps, Dade's father winces<br>
<br>
                                JUDGE<br>
                    ...and sentence you to probation, under<br>
                    which you are forbidden to own or operate<br>
                    a computer or touch tone telephone, until<br>
                    the day of your eighteenth birthday.<br>
<br>
        Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.<br>
<br>
        Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family<br>
        and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and<br>
        photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.<br>
<br>
                        SEVEN YEARS LATER.<br>
<br>
        Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the<br>
        window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the<br>
        aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a<br>
        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,<br>
        which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips<br>
        and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The<br>
        title logo.<br>
<br>
INT. DADE'S ROOM.<br>
<br>
        Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors<br>
        and at night, working on his new computer. His mother<br>
        calls him.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                                (off camera)<br>
                    Dade?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yeah, mom?<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    What are you doing?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                                (after a semi-pregnant pause)<br>
                    I'm taking over a TV network.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy<br>
                    birthday.<br>
<br>
INT. OTV STUDIOS.<br>
<br>
        In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a<br>
        man answers nervously.<br>
<br>
                                NORM<br>
                    Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from<br>
                    Accounting. I just had a power surge here at<br>
                    home that wiped out a file I was working on.<br>
                    Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know<br>
                    anything about computers?<br>
<br>
                                NORM<br>
                    Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just<br>
                    went AWOL, and I've got this big project due<br>
                    tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get<br>
                    it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari<br>
                    Kari...<br>
<br>
                                NORM<br>
                    Uhhh.. ahahaha...<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management<br>
                    techniques.<br>
                                (pause)<br>
                    Could you, uh, read me the number on the<br>
                    modem?<br>
<br>
                                NORM<br>
                    Uhhhmm...<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches<br>
                    on it... lets my computer talk to the one<br>
                    there...<br>
<br>
                                NORM<br>
                    212-555-4240.<br>
<br>
        Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry<br>
        of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.<br>
        He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and<br>
        then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback<br>
        System. There is a graphic representation of the<br>
        station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his<br>
        TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh<br>
        type TV show.<br>
<br>
                                COMMENTATOR<br>
                                (on TV)<br>
                    ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and<br>
                    Blacks come from a genetically mediocre<br>
                    stock...<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yak yak yak. Get a job!<br>
<br>
        Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer<br>
        diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm<br>
        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of<br>
        tapes.  The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and<br>
        is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade<br>
        watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.<br>
<br>
                                TV<br>
                    You are about to experience the awe and<br>
                    mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,<br>
                    to... The Outer Limits.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yesssss!<br>
<br>
        Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous<br>
        message:<br>
<br>
                        U HAVE TREAD<br>
                        UPON MY DOMAIN &<br>
                        MUST NOW SUFFER<br>
                        WHO R U?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Hey! What?<br>
<br>
        He starts to type ZERO...<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    No, wait.<br>
<br>
        Dade types:<br>
<br>
                        CRASH OVERRIDE.<br>
                        WHO WANTS TO KNOW?<br>
<br>
        Dade's screen dissolves into:<br>
<br>
                        ACID BURN<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Unbelievable. A hacker!<br>
<br>
        Then the screen changes again:<br>
<br>
                        ACID BURN<br>
                        SEZ LEAVE B 4<br>
                        U R EXPUNGED<br>
<br>
        "The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.<br>
<br>
        Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The<br>
        tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes<br>
        fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps<br>
        changing.<br>
<br>
        The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:<br>
<br>
                        I WILL<br>
                        SWAT U LIKE<br>
                        THE FLY U R<br>
<br>
        More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.<br>
        Another message.<br>
<br>
                        I WILL<br>
                        SNAP YOUR BACK<br>
                        LIKE A TOOTHPICK<br>
<br>
        As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:<br>
<br>
                        MESS WITH THE BEST<br>
                        DIE LIKE THE REST<br>
<br>
        One last from Acid Burn:<br>
<br>
                        YOU ARE<br>
                        TERMINATED<br>
<br>
        Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection<br>
        is terminated.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Shit on me!<br>
<br>
        Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges<br>
        from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging<br>
        moving boxes) for the fridge.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Mm-hmm.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Up all night again, huh?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Can this wait until both my eyes are open,<br>
                    please?<br>
<br>
        Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the<br>
        building superintendent.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll<br>
                    sleep normal hours? He's been playing with<br>
                    his computer all night for a solid week.<br>
                                (pause)<br>
                    Well yes, he could be playing with himself.<br>
                    Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,<br>
                    don't you?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as<br>
                    charming as you yet.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,<br>
                    Dade?<br>
                                (louder)<br>
                    Right, Dade?!<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!<br>
<br>
        Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks<br>
        his room. Dade is showering.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                                (angry, through the bathroom door)<br>
                    You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?<br>
                    Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up<br>
                    again and you won't get into college!<br>
<br>
        She pauses and regains some of her cool.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.<br>
                    I didn't want to sell the house but I had to<br>
                    take this new job, you know that. You're<br>
                    going to love New York, it's the city that<br>
                    never sleeps!<br>
<br>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY.<br>
<br>
        We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun<br>
        shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day<br>
        and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment<br>
        on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.<br>
<br>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL.<br>
<br>
        At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,<br>
        head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up<br>
        to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle<br>
        shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Excuse me.<br>
<br>
                                KID<br>
                    Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the<br>
                    principal's office.<br>
<br>
                                KID<br>
                    Sorry, I can't help you, okay?<br>
<br>
        Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the<br>
        office.<br>
<br>
INT. OFFICE.<br>
<br>
        Dade is filling out a form.<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    Do you have your transfer forms?<br>
<br>
        Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly<br>
        unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    It's a relatively straightforward question.<br>
<br>
        Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches<br>
        into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,<br>
        all involving lips and kissing.<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    Do you speak English?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Sorry, you wanted...?<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    I wanted transfer forms.<br>
<br>
        He gives them to her.<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    Thank you.<br>
<br>
        She starts leaving. He doesn't.<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    Are you coming?<br>
<br>
        Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on<br>
        a brief tour.<br>
<br>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is<br>
                    through there.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Great. Cool.<br>
                                (pause)<br>
                    What's your name?<br>
<br>
                                GIRL<br>
                    Kate. Kate Libby.<br>
<br>
        They arrive at a classroom.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Here's your class.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    No, you're not in my class.<br>
<br>
        Kate starts away.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Give me time!<br>
<br>
        A guy in the halls notices Dade.<br>
<br>
                                GUY<br>
                    Hey, you new?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yeah.<br>
<br>
                                GUY<br>
                    Tell him about the pool, Kate.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Pool?<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up<br>
                    on the roof. Take the stairs over there.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Yeah! Sure.<br>
<br>
        Kate starts away again.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Thanks!<br>
<br>
EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.<br>
<br>
        Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the<br>
        roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over<br>
        the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.<br>
        One of them notices Dade.<br>
<br>
                                GEEK<br>
                    Hey! Hold the door!<br>
<br>
        He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.<br>
<br>
                                Dade<br>
                                (realizing he's been had)<br>
                    No pool.<br>
<br>
        Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with<br>
        his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins<br>
        raining.<br>
<br>
INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.<br>
<br>
        Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates<br>
        leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls<br>
        through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled<br>
        in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Oh my God! He found the pool.<br>
<br>
INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.<br>
<br>
        The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade<br>
        is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to<br>
        Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing<br>
        skeletons.<br>
<br>
                                TEACHER<br>
                    I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.<br>
                    Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur<br>
                    rally. I know some of you kids got computers<br>
                    at home. But these are school property,<br>
                    people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck<br>
                    to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical<br>
                    interface...<br>
<br>
        Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been<br>
        looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking<br>
        himself into her advanced English class.<br>
<br>
EXT. SCHOOL QUAD.<br>
<br>
        It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The<br>
        latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.<br>
<br>
                                KID<br>
                    So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,<br>
                    eh? Academic? Purely sexual?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Homicidal?<br>
<br>
                                KID<br>
                    What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!<br>
<br>
        The name rings no bells with Dade.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I<br>
                    know you play the game.<br>
<br>
        Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up<br>
        to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>

<br>
        Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                                (interrupting)<br>

                                (to Dade)<br>
                    Check it, Friday.<br>
<br>
        Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                    Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,<br>

<br>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.<br>
<br>
        Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk<br>
        computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music<br>
        vendor catches Dade's attention.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Check this out, each and every one of you.<br>
                    Compilation tape, of my own making. I call<br>
                    this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring<br>
                    artists like, well I got some Hendrix on<br>
                    there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all<br>
                    great artists that asphyxiated on their own<br>
                    vomit!<br>
<br>
        The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.<br>

                    Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!<br>
<br>
        Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be<br>
        equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the<br>
        benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy<br>
        techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with<br>
        psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a<br>
        video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone.<br>
<br>
                                OPERATOR<br>

                    Please deposit five dollars for the first<br>
                    minute.<br>
<br>
        Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a<br>
        button, and the box emits a series of tones.<br>
<br>
                                OPERATOR<br>
                    Thank you.<br>

                                PHREAK<br>
                    Nonono, thank YOU!<br>
<br>
        Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video<br>
        game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.<br>
        She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the<br>
        top-10 list.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    That's a nice score for a girl.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                                (irritated by Dade's presence)<br>
                    Think you can do better?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I'll give it a shot.<br>
<br>
        Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.<br>
        Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet<br>
        above.<br>
<br>
                                CURTIS<br>
                    Is this kid bothering you, Kate?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Sorry, can I get some room here?<br>
<br>
                                CURTIS<br>
                    Yeah.<br>
                                (to Kate)<br>
                    Why don't you come up here?<br>
<br>
        Kate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing.<br>
        He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed<br>
        chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his<br>
        high score is about to come up.<br>
<br>
                                CURTIS<br>
                    He's good!<br>
<br>
        Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak<br>
        is amazed.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                                (to Kate)<br>
                    Well, it looks like I'm on top.<br>
<br>
        Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    Congratulations. No one's ever beat her<br>
                    before. You just made an enemy for life.<br>
                                (to someone else)<br>
                    Boy meets world. Let's go?<br>
<br>
EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.<br>
<br>
        Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy<br>
        world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a<br>
        little disgusted.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Who's that?<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    Curtis.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    And what's he do?<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks<br>
                    slick all day.<br>
<br>
        Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.<br>
        Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle<br>
        speeds off into the night.<br>
<br>
INT. DADE'S ROOM.<br>
<br>
        The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,<br>
        it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the<br>
        school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of<br>
        the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.<br>
<br>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.<br>
<br>
        Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.<br>
        Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    What's up?<br>
<br>
        Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more<br>
        seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire<br>
        sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He<br>
        realizes what is happening.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                                (amused and highly impressed)<br>
        Oh my God. You...<br>
<br>
        A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the<br>
        hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall<br>
        cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his<br>
        face.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    Way cool!<br>
                                (to Dade)<br>
                    You saw that?<br>
<br>
        Dade nods in the affirmative.<br>
<br>
        Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has<br>
        happened.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    What the hell is going on?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Pool on the roof must have a leak.<br>
<br>
        Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.<br>
<br>
        Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.<br>
<br>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM.<br>
<br>
        Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on<br>
        the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    If God gave men brains bigger than dogs',<br>
                    they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail<br>

                    Woooooo!<br>
<br>
        The teacher reads Dade's quotation.<br>
<br>
                                TEACHER<br>
                    "Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient<br>

                                DADE<br>
                    That's Ginsburg.<br>

                                TEACHER<br>
                    Nice. Very nice.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    He's not in this class.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I said give me time.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    He's not enrolled in this class.<br>
<br>
                                TEACHER<br>
                    Well, he's on my list.<br>
<br>
        Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the<br>
        teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy<br>
        look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher<br>
        moves on to Cereal.<br>
<br>
                                TEACHER<br>

                    You. What is your name?<br>
<br>
        The teacher grabs the list back from Kate.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?<br>
<br>
                                TEACHER<br>
                    You, however, are not on my list.<br>

                    Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?<br>
<br>
        The class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the<br>
        teacher escorts Cereal to the door.<br>
<br>
INT. DADE'S PLACE.<br>

                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    How was school?<br>

                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    What did we learn in school today?<br>

                    Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    No. No one special.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be<br>
                    home late.  And would you try and please fill<br>
                    these out?<br>
<br>
        She indicates a pile of college applications.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your<br>
                    life.<br>
<br>
        She starts to the door.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the<br>
                    lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.<br>

                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    And unpack.<br>
<br>
        She leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for<br>
        a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this<br>
        now.<br>
<br>
INT. CYBERDELIA.<br>

        Dade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is<br>
        giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter<br>

        Cereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met<br>

                    Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm<br>
                    in this computer, right. So I'm looking<br>
                    around, looking around, you know, throwing<br>
                    commands at it, I don't know where it is or<br>
                    what it does or anything. It's like, it's<br>
                    like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like<br>
                    four hours I'm just messing around in there.<br>
                    Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.<br>
                    Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this<br>
                    morning, I look in the paper, some cash<br>
                    machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out<br>

        Joey is hacking. A Gibson. He gets in. Using GOD as a<br>

<br>
INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.<br>
<br>
        The place is a mess, typical of the hacker bachelor pad.<br>
        Empty chinese food boxes and Jolt Cola cans litter the<br>

<br>
        Plague's phone is ringing, waking him.<br>

                    online, the workload is enough for like ten<br>

        Joey starts looking for something to download as proof he<br>

                    Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.<br>

        He selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His<br>
        screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip.<br>

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.<br>
<br>
        The Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin,<br>
        bearded, about 35 but still trying to be a teenage<br>
        anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that<br>

<br>
        The huge monitor lights up with the display of the<br>

        starts "surfing" around.<br>

                    "God" wouldn't be up this late.<br>

        He sees what Joey is downloading. A file called<br>
        "Garbage".<br>

        Joey is sneaking a cigarette while his computer downloads.<br>
        There is a knock at the door. It's his mother.<br>

                    Uh yeah... hold on, mom. Hold on one second.<br>

        Phreak, Dade and Cereal are rollerblading through the<br>

                    Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.<br>
                    It's a survival trait!<br>

INT. JOEY'S PLACE.<br>
<br>
        Joey is taking a shower, wearing walkman headphones,<br>
        singing along with the music. Joey finishes, turns off<br>
        the shower, still singing. He draws open the shower<br>
        curtain to find two secret service agents with shotguns<br>
        pointed at him.<br>
<br>
                                SS AGENT<br>
                    FREEZE!<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                    What? What? What did I do? What?<br>
<br>
        The agents drag Joey, still naked and wet, out of the<br>
        shower and into the living room. His mother is<br>
        hysterical..<br>
<br>
                                JOEY'S MOM<br>
                    Joey!<br>
<br>
                                AGENT<br>
                    Get in there! Sit down!<br>
<br>
                                ANOTHER AGENT<br>
                    Stay down there. Don't move.<br>
<br>
        Joey is pushed into a sofa. He sees his computer, "Lucy",<br>
        being carried away.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                    Lucy!<br>
<br>
        Joey dives onto the agent carrying Lucy away, losing his<br>
        towel.  His mother, seeing his exposed buttocks, is<br>
        shocked.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY'S MOM<br>

<br>
EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.<br>
<br>
        A police-type vehicle pulls up. It's Agent Richard Gill<br>
        of the Secret Service.  He stops a young agent for an<br>
        update.<br>

                                GILL<br>
                    How's it going, Ray?<br>
<br>
                                AGENT RAY<br>
                    It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted<br>
                    hard drive.<br>
<br>
                                GILL<br>
                    In English, please. I didn't spend ten years<br>
                    protecting the president so I could finish my<br>
                    career feeling like an idiot.<br>
<br>
                                AGENT RAY<br>
                    I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so<br>
                    we don't think he had time to erase his<br>
                    computer files.<br>
<br>
                                GILL<br>
                    Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up<br>
                    here, and take him in for interrogation.<br>
<br>
                                AGENT RAY<br>
                    Alright sir.<br>
<br>
        They split up.  A reporter and her sound man run up to<br>
        Gill.<br>
<br>
                                REPORTER<br>
                    Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your<br>
                    time?<br>

        While Jennifer conducts the interview, agents lead Joey<br>
        into an unmarked car. His mother is behind him, still<br>
        hysterical.<br>

        A handsome looking woman in her late thirties walks in.<br>

                                MARGO<br>
                    Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I<br>
                    see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                                (to Margo)<br>
                    Once again, don't call me Eugene.<br>
                                (to the board)<br>
                    A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a<br>
                    superuser acount, giving him access to our<br>
                    whole system.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    Precisely what you're paid to prevent.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Someone didn't bother reading my carefully<br>
                    prepared memo on commonly used passwords.<br>
                    Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for<br>
                    most used passwords are love,<br>
                                (gesturing lewdly)<br>
                    sex, secret and...<br>
                                (eyeing Margo)<br>
                    ...God. So would your holiness care to change<br>
                    her password?<br>

<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Yesterday, the ballast program for a<br>
                    supertanker training model mistakenly thought<br>
                    the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    Excuse me?<br>

                                (as if to a child)<br>
                    The little boat flipped over. A virus planted<br>
                    in the Gibson computer system claimed<br>
                    responsibility.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    What, it left a note?<br>
<br>
        Plague hits a button on a remote control, and the virus -<br>
        a long haired male model - appears on a large screen, in<br>
        psychedelic colors. The virus speaks in a hammy Italian<br>
        accent.<br>
<br>
                                VIRUS<br>
                    Unless five million dollars are transferred to<br>
                    the following numbered account in seven days,<br>
                    I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson<br>
                    fleet.<br>
<br>
                                BOARD MEMBER<br>
                    Is that...<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                                (interrupting)<br>
                    That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The<br>
                    problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and<br>
                    we don't know which ones are infected.<br>
<br>
                                DUKE ELLINGSON<br>
                    Well then, put the ships' ballasts under<br>
                    manual control.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These<br>
                    ships are totally computerized. They rely on<br>
                    satellite navigation, which links them to our<br>
                    network, and the virus, wherever they are in<br>
                    the world.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    So what are we supposed to do?<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented<br>
                    security officer. I traced the hacker's call.<br>
                    The secret service picked him up this morning.<br>
                    I'll just search his files for the original<br>
                    virus code, and then I can eliminate it.<br>

                    right away, yeah?<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Yeah!<br>
<br>
                                SUIT #1<br>
                    Well, how soon?<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Well, we're working on it as fast as we can.<br>
                    This is a very common occurrence in<br>
                    corporations as large as ours. You have<br>
                    nothing to worry about.<br>

<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100<br>
                    percent. Okay?<br>

                                SUIT #2<br>
                    Yeah.<br>
<br>
                                SUIT #1<br>
                    Okay.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.<br>

<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    I had to move fast. The hacker copied my<br>

<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in<br>
                    the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the<br>
                    hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we<br>
                    can't do on our own.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    I don't want to go to jail for this.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    But you've created a virus that's going to<br>

                    arrest some hacker kid?<br>

                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...<br>

                                PLAGUE<br>
                    I can cancel it any time. I don't need any<br>
                    program code. But it's the perfect cover, to<br>
                    confiscate the disc and find out how much of<br>
                    that garbage file has been copied.<br>
<br>
                                MARGO<br>
                    Get it!<br>
                                (walking away)<br>
                    Why did I ever trust you?<br>
                                (going back up the escalator)<br>
                    Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your<br>

EXT. OUTSIDE JOEY'S PLACE.<br>
<br>
        Joey's apartment building is an L-shaped skyscraper about<br>
        30 storeys high, unimpressive by New York City standards.<br>
        Two Secret Service agents are staking Joey out in a car<br>
        outside.<br>
<br>
                                SECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB<br>
                    Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's<br>
                    apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still<br>
                    grounded... by his mother.<br>
<br>
        His radio crackles.<br>

                                (he reads)<br>
                    "This is our world now. The world of the<br>
                    electron and the switch, the beauty of the<br>
                    baud. We exist without nationality, skin<br>
                    color, or religious bias. You wage wars,<br>
                    murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us<br>
                    believe it's for our own good, yet we're the<br>
                    criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is<br>
                    that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is<br>
                    my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You<br>

        behind him in the hallway. Both point pistols at him.<br>

INT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER.<br>

        Dade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens<br>
        her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade<br>
        starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and<br>
        starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind.<br>
        Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room,<br>
        handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as<br>
        Plague looks on smugly.<br>
<br>
        Then Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He<br>
        regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at<br>
        night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep.<br>

                    Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.<br>
<br>
        Joey takes a drag. The group reacts indignantly.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                    Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this.<br>
                    I got in trouble with my computer, right,<br>
                    okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an<br>
                    addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer!<br>
                    No really, really,<br>
<br>
        Joey takes another drag.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                    I'm not an addict. I'm not, I'm not.<br>
<br>
        Joey downs his coffee.<br>
<br>
                                JOEY<br>
                    Can I get some more coffee?<br>

INT. KATE'S ROOM.<br>
<br>
        Kate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in<br>
        to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own,<br>
        some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back<br>
        in.<br>

                                KATE<br>

        At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks<br>
        up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.<br>
        "Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other<br>
        hackers look on.<br>
<br>
INT. RESTAURANT.<br>
<br>
        A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,<br>
        sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is<br>
        Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the<br>
        MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's<br>
        horror.<br>

        Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and<br>
        changes an ad.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>

INT. GILL'S OFFICE.<br>
<br>
        At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone<br>
        responding to the ad.<br>
<br>
                                GILL<br>
                    I... I... I know where you can stick it... I<br>
                    know where you can stick it...<br>
<br>
        Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes<br>
        on.<br>
<br>
                                CALLER<br>

                    Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.<br>
<br>
        Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.<br>

                                CALLER<br>
                    That's why they call me Stallion...<br>

                    My heart is steaming for you...<br>
<br>
        Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.<br>

                    Aww, Spank your ass...<br>
<br>
        He punches another button.<br>
<br>
        Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,<br>
        disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,<br>
        witnessing the whole thing.<br>

        It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of<br>

        offender status to Gill's record.<br>
<br>
EXT. NEW YORK CITY, BUSY STREET.<br>
<br>
        Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police<br>
        grunt.  He is thrown onto the hood of his car and<br>
        handcuffed.<br>
<br>
                                GILL<br>

INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT.<br>
<br>
        A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a<br>
        zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands<br>
        caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body<br>
        belongs to Dade Murphy.<br>
<br>
        Kate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants<br>
        and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed<br>
        that dream.<br>

                                KATE<br>

                                KATE<br>
                    Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.<br>
<br>
        She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and<br>
        bikini bottom.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    You are man enough to stick with the deal,<br>
                    aren't you?<br>

        Dade walks off.<br>
<br>
INT. DADE'S PLACE.<br>
<br>
        Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He<br>
        takes the package.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Thanks.<br>
<br>
        He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop<br>
        computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very<br>
        high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns<br>
        it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.<br>

                    let me explain the New World Order.<br>
                    Governments and corporations need people like<br>
                    you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard<br>
                    cowboys. And all those other people out there<br>
                    who have no idea what's going on are the<br>
                    cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my<br>
                    help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,<br>
                    think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!<br>
                    Tell me where the disk is.<br>

        Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking<br>

                    You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not<br>
                    grounded anymore.<br>
<br>
        She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to<br>
        life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it<br>
        in the air vent.<br>

                                PHREAK<br>
                    Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.<br>
                    Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.<br>

                                JOEY<br>
                    I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're<br>
                    asking me about it, alright? Will you take a<br>
                    look for me?<br>
<br>
        Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,<br>
        and Phreak notices.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>
                    Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.<br>

        Joey sees, and runs for it.<br>

                    Shit!<br>

INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.<br>
<br>
        Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a<br>

        there with gum.<br>
<br>
INT. PHREAK'S ROOM.<br>

        Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking<br>

<br>
DREAM SEQUENCE.<br>
<br>
        The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He<br>
        still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically<br>
        going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.<br>
<br>

        A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.<br>

                    Time for school, come on.<br>
<br>
        The secret service bursts in through the window just as<br>
        Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps<br>
        to his feet.<br>

                    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.<br>
<br>
        Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping<br>
        Phreak, cursing in Spanish.<br>
<br>
                                PHREAK<br>

<br>
INT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.<br>
<br>
        The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened<br>
        thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he<br>
        is led to his one phone call.<br>

<br>
        The cop locks the dial on the phone.<br>
<br>
        Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He<br>
        starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a<br>
        ringing tone.<br>

                    really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the<br>

                    jail! They're charging me with some serious<br>

<br>
        Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the<br>
        boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the<br>
        condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from<br>
        the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.<br>
<br>
INT. DADE'S PLACE.<br>
<br>
        Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Hi!<br>
                                (looking Kate over)<br>
                    Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.<br>
                                (she shows them to Dade's room)<br>
                    Dade... you have company.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    It's a nice room.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    We need your help.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Do my ears deceive me?<br>
<br>
        Kate starts to leave.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got<br>
                    a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up<br>
                    call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand<br>
                    free access to data, well, it comes with some<br>
                    responsibility. When I was a child, I spake<br>
                    as a child, I understood as a child, I thought<br>
                    as a child, but when I became a man I put away<br>
                    childish things.<br>
                                (pause)<br>
                    What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse<br>
                    11, no duh. Come on.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need<br>
                    your help to figure out what's on this disc.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I can't. Everybody who touches that thing<br>
                    gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,<br>
                    I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or<br>
                    something.<br>
<br>
        Cereal leaves the room.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    What is it with you? I know we've been<br>
                    playing games, but, we're supposed to be on<br>
                    the same side and we really need your help. I<br>
                    really need your help.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I'm sorry, I can't.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?<br>
                    And just hide it in case we get busted, so we<br>
                    have something to give our lawyers, something<br>
                    that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do<br>
                    that?<br>
<br>
        A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.<br>
<br>
                                MRS. MURPHY<br>
                    Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in<br>
                    the fridge. Cereal has.<br>
<br>
        She leaves.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                                (to Mrs. Murphy)<br>
                    Thank you.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Okay. I'll copy it.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Okay, thank you.<br>
<br>
        Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's<br>
        records on his screen.<br>

                                PLAGUE<br>
                    The girl. The girl has the disc I need.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I told you, I don't play well with others.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a<br>
                    file.<br>
<br>
        Dade does.<br>
<br>
        An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's<br>
        picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into<br>
        Dade's mother.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the<br>
                    state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,<br>
                    two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.<br>
                    When she's arrested, she will not have a<br>
                    trial, she will not pass go, she will go<br>
                    directly to jail. Then I change this file<br>
                    back to the original, and your mom disappears.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    That's bullshit.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    What can I tell you. Computers never lie,<br>
                    kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,<br>
                    she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip<br>
                    searched.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse<br>
                    things than death and, uh, I can do all of<br>
                    them!<br>
<br>
        Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked<br>
        mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over<br>
        her.<br>
<br>
EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.<br>
<br>
        Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Talk to me.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's<br>
                    on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it<br>
                    out. She's not the one who planted the virus.<br>
                    You leave her alone.<br>
<br>
                                PLAGUE<br>
                    Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,<br>
                    she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?<br>
<br>
        Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives<br>
        by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,<br>
        jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase<br>
        but gives up quickly.<br>
<br>
INT. KATE'S ROOM.<br>
<br>
        Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the<br>
        disc.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Kate, listen.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Uh, hold on...<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    I have to tell you something.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Hold on a second!<br>
<br>
                                NIKON<br>
                    Look at this, it's so lean and clean.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Looks like a hacker wrote it.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.<br>
<br>
        Nikon points out part of the code.<br>
<br>
                                NIKON<br>
                    But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This<br>
                    is taking forever and a day to figure out.<br>
                    I'm gonna make some coffee.<br>
<br>
        Dade takes Nikon's place.<br>
<br>
                                CEREAL<br>
                    Tag, you're in.<br>
<br>
        Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the<br>
        garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about<br>
        anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of<br>
        half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    This isn't a virus. It's a worm!<br>
<br>
                                NIKON<br>
                    What's this one eat?<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    It nibbles. You see this?<br>
<br>
        Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    This is every financial transaction Ellingson<br>
                    conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to<br>
                    the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    And no one's caught it because the money isn't<br>
                    really gone. It's just data being shifted<br>
                    around.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out<br>
                    with the money and erases its tracks.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    Joey got cut off before he got to that part.<br>
                    Check it out. By this point, it's already<br>
                    running at, what, twice the speed as when it<br>
                    started.<br>
<br>
                                KATE<br>
                    Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...<br>

                    Two days.<br>
<br>
                                DADE<br>
                    And judging by this segment alone, it's<br>
                    already eaten about...<br>

                                KATE<br>
                    Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the<br>
                    fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and<br>
                    that's us. We've got to get the rest of the<br>
                    file, so we can find out where the money is<br>
                    going before the worm disappears, so we can<br>
                    find out WHO created it.<br>

                                DADE<br>

                                DADE<br>
                    This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a<br>

        The four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens<br>

        in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the<br>
        Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye<br>
